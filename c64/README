This is a version of Mastermind for the Commodore 64.

The source is stored as a ASCII text file (peggy.txt) and needs to be
tokenized to be run. I'm using tok64 like this:

tok64 peggy.txt

You could also run it using cbmbasic. But then you need the source in
UPPER CASE:

cat peggy.txt | tr [:lower:] [:upper:] | sed -e 's/{SPACE\*[0-9]*}/ /g' -e 's/{[A-Z ]*}//g' > PEGGY.BAS
