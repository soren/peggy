This projects tries to implement the game if Mastermind(tm) in several
languages. It's primary goal is to act as an exercise for the author.

The Rules of the Game

The object of the game is to guess the hidden code. The code consists
of four unique colors. The colors are selected from a palette of six
colors: red, green, blue, yellow, purple and cyan.

The computer selects the code, which is hidden from the player.

The player must now try and guess the code. For each guess the
computer will give a feedback showing how good the guess is. The
feedback is zero or more pegs: a white peg indicates that a correct
color has been chosen, but is at a wrong place; a black peg indicates
that a color is placed correctly.
